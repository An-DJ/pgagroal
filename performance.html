    <h2>pgagroal performance</h2>

    Performance is an important goal for pgagroal and effort have been made
    to make pgagroal scale and use a limited number of resources.
    <p/>
    This report describe pgagroal in relationship to 3 other <a href="https://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a>
    connection pool implementations, which we will call "a", "b" and "c".
    <p/>
    The <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/pgbench.html">pgbench</a> program was used in the runs. All pool
    configurations were made with performance in mind.
    <p/>
    All diagrams are using the same identifier for the connection pool in question, so "a" is "a" in all
    diagrams and so on.
    <p/>
    The runs were performed on <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux">RHEL</a> 7.7 /
    <a href="https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3358">EPEL</a> /
    <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/products/developertoolset/overview">DevTools</a> 8
    based machines on 10G network. All connection pools were the latest versions as of January 14, 2020. pgagroal was
    using the epoll mode of <a href="http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html">libev</a>.
