    <h2>Getting started with pgagroal</h2>

    First of all, make sure that pgagroal is installed and in your path by
    using "pgagroal -?". You should see

    <pre>
pgagroal 0.1.1
  High-performance connection pool for PostgreSQL

Usage:
  pgagroal [ -c CONFIG_FILE ] [ -a HBA_CONFIG_FILE ]

Options:
  -c, --config CONFIG_FILE  Set the path to the pgagroal.conf file
  -a, --hba HBA_CONFIG_FILE Set the path to the pgagroal_hba.conf file
  -V, --version             Display version information
  -?, --help                Display help
    </pre>

    If you don't have pgagroal in your path see our <a href="https://github.com/agroal/pgagroal/README.md">README</a>
    on how to compile and install pgagroal in your system.

    <h3>Configuration</h3>

    Lets create a simple configuration file called <b>pgagroal.conf</b> with the content

    <pre>
[pgagroal]
host = *
port = 2345

log_type = file
log_level = info
log_path = /tmp/pgagroal.log

idle_timeout = 600
validation = off
unix_socket_dir = /tmp/.s.pgagroal

[primary]
host = localhost
port = 5432
    </pre>

    In our main section called <b>[pgagroal]</b> we setup pgagroal to listen on all
    network addresses on port 2345. Logging will be performed at "info" level and
    put in a file called "/tmp/pgagroal.log". Then we specify that we want connections
    to be closed if they have been idle for 10 minutes, and we also specify that
    we don't want any connection validation to be performed. Last we specify the
    location of the "unix_socket_dir" used for management operations.
    <p/>
    Next we create a section called <b>[primary]</b> which has the information about our
    <a href="https://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a> instance. In this case it is running
    on "localhost" on port "5432".
    <p/>
    Now we need a host based authentication (HBA) file. Create one called <b>pgagroal_hba.conf</b>
    with the content

    <pre>
#
# TYPE  DATABASE USER  ADDRESS  METHOD
#
host    all      all   all      all
    </pre>

    This tells pgagroal that it can accept connections from all network addresses
    for all database and all user names.
    <p/>
    We are now ready to run pgagroal.

    See <a href="configuration.html">Configuration</a> for all configuration options.

    <h3>Running</h3>

    We will run pgagroal using the command

    <pre>
pgagroal -c pgagroal.conf -a pgagroal_hba.conf
    </pre>

    If this doesn't give an error, then we are ready to connect.
    <p/>
    We will assume that we have a user called "test" with the password "test" in our
    <a href="https://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a> instance. See their
    <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/index.html">documentation</a> on
    how to setup PostgreSQL,
    <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-createuser.html">add a user</a>,
    and
    <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-createdb.html">add a database</a>.
    <p/>
    We will connect to pgagroal using the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html">psql</a>
    application.

    <pre>
psql -h localhost -p 2345 -U test test
    </pre>

    That should give you a password prompt where "test" should be typed in. You are now connected
    to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a> through pgagroal.
    <p/>
    Type "\q" to quit <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html">psql</a> and pgagroal
    will now put the connection that you used into its pool.
    <p/>
    If you type the above psql command again pgagroal will reuse the existing connection and
    thereby lower the overhead of getting a connection to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a>.
    <p/>
    Now you are ready to point your applications to use pgagroal instead of going directly to
    <a href="https://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a>.
    <p/>
    pgagroal is stopped by pressing Ctrl-C (`^C`) in the console where you started it, or by sending
    the SIGTERM signal to the process using "kill pid".

    <h3>Administration</h3>

    pgagroal has an administration tool called pgagroal-cli.
    <p/>
    You can see the commands it supports by using "pgagroal-cli -?" which will give

    <pre>
pgagroal-cli 0.1.1
  Command line utility for pgagroal

Usage:
  pgagroal-cli [ -c CONFIG_FILE ] [ COMMAND ]

Options:
  -c, --config CONFIG_FILE Set the path to the pgagroal.conf file
  -V, --version            Display version information
  -?, --help               Display help

Commands:
  flush-idle               Flush idle connections
  flush-gracefully         Flush all connections gracefully
  flush-all                Flush all connections. USE WITH CAUTION !
    </pre>

    This tool can be used on the machine running pgagroal to flush connections.
    <p/>
    To flush all idle connections you would use

    <pre>
pgagroal-cli -c pgagroal.conf flush-idle
    </pre>
