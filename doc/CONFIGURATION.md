# pgagroal configuration

The configuration is loaded from either the path specified by the `-c` flag or `/etc/pgagroal.conf`.

The configuration of `pgagroal` is split into sections using the `[` and `]` characters.

The main section, called `[pgagroal]`, is where you configure the overall properties
of the connection pool.

Other sections doesn't have any requirements to their naming so you can give them
meaningful names like `[primary]` for the primary [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org)
instance.

All properties are in the format `key = value`.

The characters `#` and `;` can be used for comments; must be the first character on the line.
The `Bool` data type supports the following values: `on`, `1`, `true`, `off`, `0` and `false`.

See a [sample](./etc/pgagroal.conf) configuration for running `pgagroal` on `localhost`.
